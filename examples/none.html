        <h1>An h1 header</h1>
<p>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code>monospace</code>. Itemized lists
look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>this one</li>
<li>that one</li>
<li>the other one</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quotes are
written like so.</p>
<p>They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. </p>
